API
===

Upload the file using...

	POST https://api.textract.io/text?api_key=... <file-inside-body>

And obtain the raw extracted text in the response. That's it! We love simplicity.

Libraries
---------

Once you got an *API key*, use the HTTP API directly or use a library in your favourite language (more coming soon).

Features
--------

- Convert almost any type of document as text. [See the complete list](documentation/supported-file-formats.md).
- Includes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to analyze scanned documents. [See supported languages](documentation/supported-OCR-languages.md).
- Fast & scalable.

Pricing
-------

During our beta phase, until end of 2019, it's free! Use it as much as you want!

The pricing afterwards is not yet determined. Two things are sure though: a free tier will remain available for low usage, while the intensive usage pricing will be very affordable.
