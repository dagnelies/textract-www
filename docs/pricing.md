### Per "document or minute"?

Most documents (like office documents, emails...) require less than a second to be converted. They will cost you 0.01 € per document.

Other documents like scanned images require more intensive computing to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Depending on the document and the amount of text to be recognized, this can take several minutes. Such a document would cost 0.01 € per minute required to extract the text.
